* Abstract:
    * Whole slide imaging (WSI) is transforming the practice of pathology, converting a qualitative discipline into a quantitative one. However, one must exercise caution in interpreting algorithm assertions, particularly in pathology where an incorrect classification could have profound impacts on a patient, and rare classes exist that may not have been seen by the algorithm during training. 
    * A more robust approach would be to identify areas of an image for which the pathologist should concentrate their effort to make a final diagnosis. 
        * This anomaly detection strategy would be ideal for WSI, but given the extremely high resolution and large file sizes, such an approach is difficult. 
        * Here, we combine progressive generative adversarial networks with a flexible adversarial autoencoder architecture capable of learning the “normal distribution” of WSIs of normal skin tissue at extremely high resolution and demonstrate its anomaly detection performance. 
    * Our approach yielded pixel-level accuracy of 89% for identifying melanoma, suggesting that our label-free anomaly detection pipeline is a viable strategy for generating high quality annotations - without tedious manual segmentation by pathologists.
