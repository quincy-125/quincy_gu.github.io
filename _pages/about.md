Qiangqiang(Quincy) Gu is a Ph.D. candidate in [biomathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_and_theoretical_biology), [bioinformatics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioinformatics), and [computational biology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computational_biology) trained jointly by the [University of Minnesota - Twin Cities](https://twin-cities.umn.edu) and the [Mayo Clinic Graduate School of Biomedical Sciences](https://college.mayo.edu). He also holds a bachelor degree from the [University of Minnesota - Twin Cities in mathematics](https://cse.umn.edu/math). 
With primary interests in medicine and engineering, Quincy served as an undergraduate research assistant at the [University of Minnesota Medical School](https://med.umn.edu), where he did research on [colorectal cancer](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/colorectal/basic_info/what-is-colorectal-cancer.htm) patients [survival analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Survival_analysis) and [breast cancer](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/breast-cancer/symptoms-causes/syc-20352470) [MRI](https://www.mayoclinic.org/tests-procedures/mri/about/pac-20384768) image processing. His previous research experience convinced him that he could be a dedicated medical science researcher in the future by pursing a doctoral degree.
After joining Mayo Clinic, he has focused his research on [computer vision](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_vision) and [digital pathology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_pathology). With special interest in [melanoma](https://www.mayoclinic.org/diseases-conditions/melanoma/symptoms-causes/syc-20374884), Quincy is developing [artificial intelligence (AI)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_intelligence) algorithms in [Whole Slide Images (WSIs)](https://digitalpathologyassociation.org/whole-slide-imaging-repository) analysis, which aims to support clinical melanoma diagnostics and treatment by providing automatic melanoma diagnostics and individualized therapeutic options.
Quincy is looking forward to continuing his education in the medical doctoral (MD) training program after graduating from the Ph.D. program. He is particularly interested in being a physician-scientist to provide direct patient care and contribute to the innovations in cancer diagnostics and therapies as his long-term career goal.
