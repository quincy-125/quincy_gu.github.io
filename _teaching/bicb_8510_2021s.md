This course is taught in modular form. Overview of topics in, for instance, molecular biology and genetics; mathematics, statistics and biostatistics; programming in FORTRAN and C/C++; programming in Perl; data management; data mining.

Details of this course could be found in below:
* Course Description:
    * This course will be taught in modular form and will provide first-year graduate students with an overview of topics in molecular biology and genetics; mathematics, statistics and biostatistics
    * Programming in FORTRAN, C/C++, Perl 
    * Data management, and data mining 
    * The modules will be offered based on the needs of each incoming class of BICB graduate students.
* Goals for the Course: 
    * Based on student feedbacks from last semester, students will be lectured on topics in areas such as molecular biology and genetics; mathematics, statistics and biostatistics; data management; data mining etc. that they have never taken but are important for their graduate research. The goal is to provide appropriate lectures to fill in the students’ gap of skill/knowledge
