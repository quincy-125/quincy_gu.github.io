[This course](https://onestop2.umn.edu/pcas/viewCatalogCourse.do?courseId=792199) will support first-semester College of Liberal Arts transfer students in making a smooth transition and connect them with campus resources. Although online, some in-person assignments are required (available at various times) to help students benefit from resources, meet people, and develop a sense of belonging on campus. Time will also be dedicated to major exploration and career/post-graduation planning, so that students are well-prepared to meet their individual goals. Some weekly lessons will carefully relate to CLA's Career Readiness themes, and involve taking a personal assessment and finalizing a new resume. Prereq: Must be a new CLA transfer student in their first semester on the UMTC campus.
